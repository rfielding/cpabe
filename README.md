EC Pairings over bn256
==================

This uses bn256 pairing to generate a cpabe key.  There is a CA, a certificate, and a yaml format for the policies.  What is demonstrated is "monotone" access (`and`, `or`, with negated assertions - but cannot do `not`, because that cannot produce a specific witness.)
